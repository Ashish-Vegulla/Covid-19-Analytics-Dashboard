Covid-19 Analytics DashBoard Using IBM  Cognos

# To create a COVID-19 analytics dashboard using IBM Cognos , you can follow these steps:

1. Import the Dataset: Import the dataset containing the COVID-19 data into IBM Cognos. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and organized.

2. Create a Data Source: Create a data source in IBM Cognos using the imported dataset. Connect the data source to the dataset, ensuring that the appropriate fields are mapped correctly.

3. Create a Dashboard: Create a new dashboard in IBM Cognos to display the COVID-19 analytics. Choose a suitable layout and design for your dashboard.

4. Add Visualizations: Add visualizations to the dashboard to represent the COVID-19 data. Based on the given attributes, you can consider the following visualizations:

   a. Line Chart: Use the "Date" attribute on the X-axis and the "Confirmed" attribute on the Y-axis to show the trend of confirmed cases over time. You can also add separate lines for "ConfirmedIndianNational," "ConfirmedForeignNational," "Cured," and "Deaths" to track their respective trends.

   b. Bar Chart: Create a bar chart using the "State/UnionTerritory" attribute on the X-axis and the "Confirmed" attribute on the Y-axis to compare the total confirmed cases across different states or union territories.

   c. Pie Chart: Use a pie chart to represent the distribution of cases by combining the attributes "ConfirmedIndianNational," "ConfirmedForeignNational," "Cured," and "Deaths" into a single calculation, as mentioned in the question.

5. Apply Filters and Interactivity: Implement filters and interactivity options to allow users to drill down into specific data subsets. Users should be able to filter the data by date, state/union territory, or other relevant attributes.

6. Add Additional Metrics: Consider adding additional calculated metrics based on the given attributes. For example, you can calculate the percentage of cured cases or the case fatality rate (deaths divided by confirmed cases).

7. Customize the Dashboard: Customize the appearance of the dashboard by adding titles, legends, and descriptions to make it more informative and user-friendly.

8. Test and Publish: Test the dashboard thoroughly to ensure that the data and visualizations are accurate. Once satisfied, publish the dashboard to make it accessible to users.

Remember to follow the IBM Cognos documentation and user guides for detailed instructions on creating and customizing dashboards using IBM Cognos.
